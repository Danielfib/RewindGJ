RewindGJ

To Grow is about using your mistakes to become better.

In this sidescroller, you play as a patient who is in a regression therapy session. In this session, you go through challenges of your past, and as you make mistakes, they rewind to a few seconds before you made it.

The catch is, while they are rewinding, you can use them to get to places you couldn't get before!

Plan your mistakes, take advantage of past errors, and get through this journey of self-learning and improvement!
